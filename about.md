# About the Podcast

Changeling the Podcast is a weekly exploration of the roleplaying game Changeling the Dreaming. Episodes range from readthroughs of books, to interviews with people relevant to Changeling, to deep dives into various topics. We are two fans of the game who are excited to share our love for Changeling with you all.

# Our Hosts

## Joshua Hillerup

Josh has been playing and running Changeling the Dreaming since the 1990s, and still has a huge love for this game. He first got into Changeling through LARP, and he still has a lot of that mindset when approaching the game. He likes player driven stories, and tends to throw in a lot of crossover and stranger things into games that he runs.

Outside of Changeling, Josh lives in Ottawa, Canada, and has a fairly Banal sounding job in IT. He has two kids, one of which he's managed to get into Changeling, and enjoys other nerdy hobbies like philosophy and obscure programming languages in his spare time.

## Pooka G

Pooka also started playing Changeling in the late 1990s, after the novelty of playing (alternately) a half-elf druid with a pet rust monster and a Brujah punk-philosopher wore off. They were mostly involved in discussions and narrative-heavy games on the old World of Darkness forums run by White Wolf in the early 00s, followed by the Shadow and Essence forums in the late 00s. Pandemic isolation led to a renewed dive into the world of online RPG community, and homebrewing up a storm.

Currently, Pooka is based in Philadelphia, where they do linguist things and teach a little of this, a little of that at a local college. Other hobbies include all things music-related, occult shit, and searching for pastries that have never touched the tongues of mortals.
